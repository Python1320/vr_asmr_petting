# Virtual Reality Petting Etiquette: From Nice to Necessary


## Abstract

The metaverse can be considered to be a network of shared virtual environments where people can interact with each other through their virtual avatars. Although the environment is virtual, interactions are very real and therefore a social etiquette similar to real life (often unwritten) etiquette should be established. This paper aims to form an etiquette for approximate physical contact equivalent, which is giving people pets. We observe different techniques and how to request consent and maintain comfort throughout the whole interaction. We also survey people on their petting experiences and draw conclusions on the necessity of simulating physical interactions to deepen the metaverse immersion.

## Background

### Body language and FBT

Interactions in metaverse are limited by each user's tracking. Interaction components include:
 1. Microphone
 2. Display
 3. Display position tracking
 4. Hand controllers
 5. Controller trackers
 6. Text interaction
 7. Speech interaction
 8. Facial interactions
 9. Eye interactions
 9. Leg/waist interactions / tracking

### Survey

 1. Have you received physical contact / pets in metaverse
   1. Which interaction components did you have
   2. Which interaction components did the other person have
 2. Have you given physical contact / pets in metaverse
   1. Which interaction components did you have
   2. Which interaction components did the other person have
 3. Do you experience "phantom touch"
   A phantom touch can be described as a tingly sensa....
   - Not at all  
   - sometimes 
   - often 
   - always
 4. Do you have a specific spot for phantom experience
   - Head
   - Belly
   - Sides
   - Noseridge
   - Nose
 5. Which parts are uncomfortable 
 6. Age/Sex/Gender/VR Years/FPS Games
 7. Motion sickness in cars (driving/passenger)
 8. Motion sickness in VR
 9. How many months since/until beginning you disabled personal space safety boundary in VR




## Optimal Positional Calibration
In order to provide a thoroughly immersive experience, a visual calibration is recommended. Full body users have an extra step.
 1. Switch to avatar where a fingertip can be observed clipping easily when poking at an eye
 2. Ask them to "*move such that your right eye center clips ever so slightly with the fingertip*"
 3. Make sure you can still see the fingertip at this point. 
 4. Remember this point as the spot how deep to go. It may be surprisingly deep inside the eyes or face. Do not go deeper except from the sides to not clip with your avatar.
 5. Use this position instead of the surface of avatar to pet deep enough for immersive pets.
 6. Full body users: Make sure their FBT setting is set to [`lock head`](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/ik-20-features-and-options#lock-types) or the head position may change. Petting the same avatar between different people may not be possible.
 
 

**Note:** For desktop users the viewpoint is the same as non-fbt users but in the center, therefore pet with hands very close to each other.
